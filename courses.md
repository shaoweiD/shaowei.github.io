**Here are couseworks I have taken so far in graduate school at Iowa State University:<br/>**

### Fall 2013<br/>
1. #### ABE 551. Food and Bioprocess Engineering.(TAed in 2014)<br/>
(Dual-listed with A B E 451). (3-0) Cr. 3. F. Prereq: A B E 216 and M E 436 or CH E 357, or FS HN 351 and MATH 266 or MATH 267<br/>
Application of engineering principles and mathematical modeling to the quantitative analysis of food and bioprocessing systems. Physical/chemical characteristics of foods and biological systems, flow processes, thermal processes and separation processes. Term paper required for graduate credit.<br/>

2. #### STAT 401. Statistical Methods for Research Workers.<br/>
(3-2) Cr. 4. F.S.SS. Prereq: STAT 101 or STAT 104 or STAT 105 or STAT 201 or STAT 226<br/>
Graduate students without an equivalent course should contact the department. Methods of analyzing and interpreting experimental and survey data. Statistical concepts and models; estimation; hypothesis tests with continuous and discrete data; simple and multiple linear regression and correlation; introduction to analysis of variance and blocking. Only one of STAT 301 and 401 may count toward graduation.<br/>

3. #### STAT 407. Methods of Multivariate Analysis.
(2-2) Cr. 3. F. Prereq: STAT 301 or STAT 326 or STAT 401, knowledge of matrix algebra<br/>
Techniques for displaying and analyzing multivariate data including plotting high-dimensional data using interactive graphics, comparing group mean vectors using Hotelling's T2, multivariate analysis of variance, reducing variable dimension with principal components, grouping/classifying observations with cluster analysis and discriminant analysis. Imputation of missing multivariate observations.<br/>

4. #### VPTH 590A. Special Topic in Vet. Pathology. Cr. 4. Introduction of retinal diseases and prion disease.<br/>

5. #### STAT 579. An Introduction to R.
(0-2) Cr. 1. F. Prereq: Enrollment in STAT 500<br/>
An introduction to the logic of programming, numerical algorithms, and graphics. The R statistical programming environment will be used to demonstrate how data can be stored, manipulated, plotted, and analyzed using both built-in functions and user extensions. Concepts of modularization, looping, vectorization, conditional execution, and function construction will be emphasized.<br/>

6. #### ABE 601 (Cross-listed with TSM). (1-0) Cr. 1. F. <br/>
Keys to writing a good MS thesis or PhD dissertation. How to begin formulating research problems. Discussion of research problems and broader impacts, review of literature, identifying knowledge gaps and needs, long-term goals, research hypotheses, objectives, rationale and significance, methods, procedures, data analysis, and reporting results. Presentation of research proposal in different formats. Using peer review and responding to feedback.<br/>
### Spring 2014 <br/>
####STAT 585X.
Data Technologies for Statistical Analysis. (3-0) Cr. 3. Prereq: STAT 579. <br/>
Introduction to computational methods for data analysis. Accessing and managing data formats: flat files, databases, web technologies based on mark-up languages (SML, KML, HTML), netCDF. Elements of text processing: regular expressions for cleaning data. Working with massive data, handling missing data, scaled computing. Efficient programming, reproducible code.
